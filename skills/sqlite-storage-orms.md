# Connecting to SQLite with ORMs

Writing SQL is really fast and itâ€™s great for small projects. As your projects grow, you might want to take advantage of an ORM or query builder instead. Here are a few examples of how to do that with popular tools.

## Drizzle

```ts
// @stevekrouse/sqliteDrizzleExample
import { sqlite } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite";
import { sql } from "npm:drizzle-orm";
import { drizzle } from "npm:drizzle-orm/libsql";
import { integer, sqliteTable, text } from "npm:drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

const db = drizzle(sqlite as any);
const kv = sqliteTable("kv", {
  key: text("key").primaryKey(),
  value: text("value").notNull(),
});
export let sqliteDrizzleExample = db.select().from(kv).all();
```

## Prisma

ðŸš« Prisma isnâ€™t supported in Val Town because it relies on functionality that only exists in a classic server environment.

## Sequelize

ðŸš« Sequelize isnâ€™t supported in Val Town because it relies on specific database drivers and is not extensible.
